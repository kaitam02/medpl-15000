  <h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>In this assignment. I created the eye using image of an eye decoration I found online. I used 2 sets of complimentary color with the total of 8 colors. It was composed of circles and triangles, with altered circles to form the skin part of the eye with thin outline, circles and triangles to form the inner parts. I used darker and thicker line to recreate the effect of wrinkles similar to an eyes of an elderly. I also used red brush to draw vein to recreate a blood-shot eye to emphasize the element of staring. The triangles on the iris serve to lead the viewer’s focus into the eye’s pupil, making the viewer to lock eyes with this staring eyes the moment they see this image. It is an attempt recreate unease of an anxious person when forced into an uncomfortable confrontation. The feeling of threat even there is not physical dangerous.</p>
