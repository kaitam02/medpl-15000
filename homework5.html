  <h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>In this assignment. I picked Amakawa-2 from Homework#4 as the base and created shapes in Adobe Illustrator. I kept the overall washout blue tone to achieve the effects of low effect photoshop promotional movie poster akin to 90s from Hong Kong. Hong Kong was famous for it productions of Crime dramas in the 90s, example like Infernal Affairs. The Jail life or “Iron barred window life” is often a common theme in these movies. It is term “Jail life” itself is actually contrary to as in Cantonese as being in jail is also viewed as completely loss of one’s life. In this Photomontage I created iron bar in Illustrator to cover part of the image to recreate the contrary theme of “Jail” and “Life”. I pick the abandon building to depict how life outside the jail would waste away. Sharing with the viewer the point of view of a jailed and how their old life outside the bar breaking piece by piece and jail is now they only life.</p>
