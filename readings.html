  <h2>Susan Sontag's On photography</h2>
  <p>Photographs were once used as a form of evidence on many occasions, ranging from daily discussions between individuals, news reports, education and researches materials, to proofs that would topple the most perfect liar on a murder case. In contradiction, photos can be deceiving and manipulated into telling a convincing lie. Even before the debut of image generating AI that can merge and edit photos into something inexistent or the software that can turn a mundane photo into mastery, photographers were already creating photos that portray the wildest imaginations. They would use tricks to manipulate lights, taking advantage of distance and exposure settings to create these convincing lie. </p>
  <p>In the chapter “in Plato’s Cave” from the book “On Photography” by Susan Sontag. The author explored the coming of photography. Photography was once a hobby of fancy toys of the rich with no clear social use. Industrialization introduced photography to the general public. Its first popular purpose was to serve as a tool to memorialize an individual as a member of a family or a group. Cameras were the ideal tool to capture experience and allowed people to look at the world as a set of photograph. Undeniably it was a useful tool that provided incontrovertible proof of an event that took place even if the photos were distorted.</p>
  <p>The author compared photographs to paintings and written literature. It provide more knowledge of the past and the present than painting and written literatures. She claimed the painting and literature of an event were more of an interpretation by the creators rather than a truthful depiction. Photos were more innocent and accurately related to the visible reality than other mimetic objects. While the photographs provided more accurate record of the event, they were too subjected to the photographers’ own interpretation. In the present era, the credibility of a photograph was shrinking by the minutes with more and newer way to alter the photo.</p>
  <p>Some argued that photography had become a surveillance tool used by the modern states to control the population. Similar to gun and car, camera was also an addicting machinery with trigger to operate. Cameras were akin to a predatory weapon. While the camera did not kill its subject, the act of photographing someone was a predatory act. It could be viewed as an act to violate the subject’s privacy. This eventually led to some people reacting stronger to being pointed at by camera than gun. It became more so in the present with social media that a photo could led to social death of an individual.</p>
  <p>The author also emphasized that photos were not just the result of an event, but photography had become an event itself. She claimed that photography had become less about record and artistic, but more about obligation. People with ruthless work ethic like the Germany, Japanese, and Americans would use photography as a friendly imitation of their jobs. These tourists would feel compelled to take photos of any attractive landmark on a trip that was supposed to focus on experience and exploration. The need of confirming reality with photograph had become a form of addiction of consumerism that compelled people into “images junkies” and neglect the actual reality. </p>

  <h2>With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster</h2>
  <P>“Art” or media created by artificial intelligence are getting more involved in our daily lives. From social media, political promotion, to business advertisement, and meme. People are pumping out low quality of media they “created” in scale never seen in the history of mankind. Humans have never experienced a leap this big in advancement of expressing their idea. In the article “With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster” by Nesrine Malik, the author expressed how AI created fake yet very convincing media in an alarming rate. While the future he foresees is terrifying, humans experiences similar events throughout the evolution of media.</P>
  <p>This situation with AI is similar to era ago when literacy and written language became achievable to common folk in some cultures. People was able to express their idea and opinions besides just verbal words. They can leave behind a lasting piece of their mind in the form of stone tablet, a scroll, or book. Yet shortly come to a problem of telling which written piece is telling the truth. A local officer could send in a desperate mail to the emperor in chaos of flood. While their superior could pen another report claiming all is well. An emperor thousands of miles away had no way to prove which was telling the truth. </p>
  <p>A common saying is that a photo is worth a thousand words, and our ancestors born before the invention of camera created paintings and sculptures as a way to surpass literature in attempt to record the historical event. But these forms of art too showed their flaw that the creations do not bound by the reality, they could too portray a non-existent reality. Artists with political bias could paint their enemies into unspeakable, foul, insect-like sub-humans.</p>
  <p>Photography that was often viewed as a capture of truth too had subjected same fate. Photographers would manipulate light to create illusion to fool their viewers. It too shortly became a tool to create fake media.</p>
  <p>The media created by artificial intelligence is undeniably convincing at first glance, but their flaws are bright as the sun to those who obverses carefully. In time the population will too learn to differentiate the AI created media from the real media just like we are able to tell which is a fictional literature, a painting of imaginary reality, and a photograph created with trick of light and composition. The major challenge would be to find the real media amid the ocean of fake, more eye-catching media.</p>
