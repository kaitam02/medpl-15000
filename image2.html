<h1>Image 2</h1>

<p>This image is chosen to represent my attempt to photograph using the Rule of Thirds. The camera were focusing on the closest stone fence with large aperture to achieve bokeh on the street view. Focusing on everyday-object that often neglected by photographers when surrounded by more attractive subjects like skyscapers and pedestrians. Brightness/contrast, Color balance, and Tone Curve layers were used in attempt to bring in animation tone in coloring the shadow with colder colors.</p>
