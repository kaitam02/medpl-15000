 <p>In this assignment, comparison between really photograph blur and artificial are made. The really photographic blue or known as bokeh, was created by the camera and lens with large aperture, focal length, and focused object distance artificial. The artificial blur are created by adding computer generated blur by Photoshop. While they do both capable to “achieve” the same goal in blurring the background, the result can be day and night under the watchful eyes of reviewers and hobbyist. The quality of Bokeh is a major factor in the eyes of many photographers who spent thousands to get the ideal transition between the focused object and blurred background. A “creamy” Bokeh can boost a photograph of mundane subject into more attractive art piece. The artificial blur is also useful for photograph in budget or the photograph would not be judged as a high standard. With advancement of AI, the “quality of blur they can achieve will be closer to “perfect”. Which then photographers may seek to chance after the imperfection like they do with film grain from film camera now. Another useful tool is the straighten tool from Photoshop which allow many to achieve the result of a tilt-shift lens, a specialty lens that is difficult to operate for newer photographers and less budget friendly.</p>
