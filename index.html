<h1>Kai Tam</h1>
<p>My name is Kai Tam. I am an immigrant from Macau, an once small fishing village colonized by Portuguese turned into a gambling city now governed by China. An city with shiny new skyscapers stood among dusty and old if not abandoned for decades buildings. I too interested in art though I am major in nursing. In fact, I was first dreamed to by an artist in digital arts and papercrafts, as they both are significant in my path of an artist. Papercrafts opened the door of digital art to me in a way of MS Paint when I was 8. Then I began to explore anime style drawing in my Highschool age with Photoshop, Clip Studio, and SAI Paint. I took inspiration from Miyazaki Hayao, Makoto Shinkai, and Tanaka Romio. My art focused on the daily life in world where humanity lost the ability to advance in technology after series of calamity. A world slowing reclaimed by nature with hints of the past disasters that rewards the audiances with more insight. Instead of focusing on rivalry, politic, and struggle for survival in a deserted world. I fantasize a declined world akin to Tanaka Romio that people remain civilized, acknowledged that humans are stepping down from the stage. Showing the charmed details from daily life and nature similar to Hayao Miyazaki's creations. Daily life and declined world are very popular themes in art creations, which led to AI getting mroe efficient at "creating" them. I upheld the old fashion way and create my arts without any touch of AI.</p>
